# How to Contribute to the CGCC Blog

For small spelling corrections and other grammatical errors, feel free to issue a pull request to the said file.

Any new contributions/bigger changes should go into the latest blog entry number.(as of the creation of this document, it is blog_2.) This must be done after you add your idea to the [idea collection post](https://codegolf.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/22070/what-should-we-write-about-on-our-blog), and confirm that you will be ready to write about it. 

It is encouraged to discuss about any new article contributions in the [CGCC Blog Chat](https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/123200/cgcc-blog-chat), which requires a StackExchange account. You can also try to communicate through the [CGCC Discord Server](https://discord.gg/s8Qf2CGxMw), by pinging @Razetime. Do note that this may not be as effective, since many blog contributors do not own Discord accounts.
