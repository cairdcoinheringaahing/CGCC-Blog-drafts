"The history of PPCG and CGCC". Written by caird

---

Break down into "eras":

- The beginning; SO and the move to PPCG. Appointment of mods, establishment of early site rules.
- Trolls in our halls; [code-trolling] and the first boom in activity
- 2016: Graduation and becoming a grown up site
- The peak in site activity; 2018 election, ch-ch-changes and the first cracks begin to show
- The Great Exodus; Monica's firing, the relicensing and the loss of many users
- A new era of new faces; 2020 election, new users and the future
