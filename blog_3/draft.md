# CGCC Blog Post #3: The history of PPCG and CGCC

On September 15th 2008, to celebrate the official public launch of Stack Overflow, [Chris Jester-Young][CJY SO] posted the [very first code golf question on SO][First code golf on SO]. For a few years, [\[code-golf\]][SO code golf tag] problems popped up from time to time on SO. However, people [started][Dislike code golf on SO 1] [expressing][Dislike code golf on SO 2] [dislike][Dislike code golf on SO 3] for these questions, claiming they weren't really a part of the Q&A system that SO was based on. And so, a proposal for a [new site][Code golf Area 51 proposal] was created on the 8th of June 2010, and entered private beta 6 months later.

Just over 10 years ago, Code Golf Stack Exchange came into existance. Since then, we've developed rules, gone through multiple cultural shifts and have changed drastically as a site. I'm a relatively new user, compared to some. I joined in March 2017, right as we were experiencing our all time peak in activity. I wasn't around for a lot of CGCC's history, but I've managed to isolate it down to 5 or 6 "eras" and I hope I can tell them accurately.

## The beginning

On January 27th, 2011, CGCC entered its private beta, lasting for a week. 258 users joined during that beta, including [Peter Taylor], [gnibbler] and [Chris Jester-Young], who were just a few of the earliest and most influential users at site creation. [This][First users] is a  list of those users who posted, many of whom set the groundwork for the site. A couple of weeks later, Chris Jester-Young, [dmckee] and gnibbler were [appointed as moderators][Pro tem mods] and Code Golf officially joined the ranks of SE sites.

For the first couple of years, the site sort of just continued along. We averaged around 3 questions per day and had a consistent yet low intake of new and active users. However [J], [Golfscript] and [APL] dominated on the site, which upset [a lot of people][J and Golfscript bad] - a discussion we've had [many times][Are golflangs good]. Despite this common complaint, the site was quiet but nothing was especially problematic. Until a troll arrived.

## [tag:code-trolling] and the activity boom

[tag:code-trolling] challenges began on December 27, 2013 when the [first one][First code trolling question] was posted as an experimental new challenge type. It was immediately a smash, hitting 100 upvotes and 10k views in less than 14 hours, and receiving more than 80 answers. The next day, 8 more [tag:code-trolling] challenges were posted, and the site experienced a massive boom in activity. A few days later, the [second highest voted challenge] was posted, and even more users joined the site. Most notably, future moderator and all around [awesome person][Dennis is awesome] [Dennis], who would later go on to shape much of the community.

Unfortuantely, code trolling questions are not high quality. Most of them were so broad as to basically be "write some code that has something to do with <insert task here>", and they were [leaking into the network][Trolls in our halls]. Many people disliked them, they were decreasing the quality of questions on the site, and so, after a few months, an [official stance was taken][Official stance on code trolling]: [tag:code-trolling] is no longer welcome. A massive clean up was organised, and 47 of the 60 existing [tag:code-trolling] questions were removed. If you have 10000 or more reputation and would like to see those, [here's a query with links][21].
