## Welcome to the first CGCC Blog post!

After [7 years](https://codegolf.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1446/code-golf-blog-phase-1-raise-the-idea-on-the-meta-site), and three attempts, we've finally started a site blog, for posts and topics that the community here on CGCC is likely to find interesting. If you'd like to suggest topics, or would like to write a post about something specific, feel free to head over to our [ideas thread](https://codegolf.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/22070/what-should-we-write-about-on-our-blog) and write up a suggestion!

Intially, the idea for a blog came about when Stack Exchange was promoting [BlogOverflow](https://stackoverflow.blog/2011/06/23/blog-overflow/) back in 2014. Unfortunately, the idea ["sort of just... stopped"](https://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/15461516#15461516) and never came to fruition. 4 years ago, [BlogOverflow stopped](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/291741/we-will-no-longer-be-hosting-blog-overflow), right as there was [renewed interest](https://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/240?m=32929735#32929735) in having one, so we moved [off-site](https://medium.com/code-golf) for a while, before stagnating again. Finally, we decided to give it another shot, which is why you're reading this now!

If you'd like to see all the blog posts, check out the [meta-tag:blog] tag - all the posts are collected there, and each post has that tag. If you'd like to check out our [drafting and discussion room](https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/123200/cgcc-blog-chat), feel free to drop by and ask any questions you have. For our very first post, we've decided to write about the basics of language design and development, a topic relevant to a lof of CGCC users who have decided to create their own programming languages. Additionally, read to the end to find the first of our recurring sections on underappreciated answers and rarely used but interesting esoteric languages.

Enjoy!
