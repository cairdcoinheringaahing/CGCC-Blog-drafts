# CGCC Blog Post #3: The history of PPCG and CGCC

On September 15th 2008, to celebrate the official public launch of Stack Overflow, [Chris Jester-Young][CJY SO] posted the [very first code golf question on SO][First code golf on SO]. For a few years, [\[code-golf\]][SO code golf tag] problems popped up from time to time on SO. However, people [started][Dislike code golf on SO 1] [expressing][Dislike code golf on SO 2] [dislike][Dislike code golf on SO 3] for these questions, claiming they weren't really a part of the Q&A system that SO was based on. And so, a proposal for a [new site][Code golf Area 51 proposal] was created on the 8th of June 2010, and entered private beta 6 months later.

Just over 10 years ago, Code Golf Stack Exchange came into existance. Since then, we've developed rules, gone through multiple cultural shifts and have changed drastically as a site. I'm a relatively new user, compared to some. I joined in March 2017, right as we were experiencing our all time peak in activity. I wasn't around for a lot of CGCC's history, but I've managed to isolate it down to 5 or 6 "eras" and I hope I can tell them accurately.

<sub>This post contains the rough "story" of the site, and a lot of links to the full details. You shouldn't have to click on any of the links in order to understand something, but it'll definitely help</sub>

## The beginning

On January 27th, 2011, CGCC entered its private beta, lasting for a week. 258 users joined during that beta, including [Peter Taylor], [gnibbler] and [Chris Jester-Young], who were just a few of the earliest and most influential users at site creation. [This][First users] is a  list of those users who posted, many of whom set the groundwork for the site. A couple of weeks later, Chris Jester-Young, [dmckee] and gnibbler were [appointed as moderators][Pro tem mods] and Code Golf officially joined the ranks of SE sites.

For the first couple of years, the site sort of just continued along. We averaged around 3 questions per day and had a consistent yet low intake of new and active users. However [J], [Golfscript] and [APL] dominated on the site, which upset [a lot of people][J and Golfscript bad] - a discussion we've had [many times][Are golflangs good]. Despite this common complaint, the site was quiet but nothing was especially problematic. Until a troll arrived.

## [tag:code-trolling] and the activity boom

[tag:code-trolling] challenges began on December 27, 2013 when the [first one][First code trolling question] was posted as an experimental new challenge type. It was immediately a smash, hitting 100 upvotes and 10k views in less than 14 hours, and receiving more than 80 answers. The next day, 8 more [tag:code-trolling] challenges were posted, and the site experienced a massive boom in activity. A few days later, the [second highest voted challenge] was posted, and even more users joined the site. Most notably, future moderator and all around [awesome person][Dennis is awesome] [Dennis], who would later go on to shape much of the community.

Unfortuantely, code trolling questions are not high quality. Most of them were so broad as to basically be "write some code that has something to do with \<insert task here>", and they were [leaking into the network][Trolls in our halls]. Many people disliked them, they were decreasing the quality of questions on the site, and so, after a few months, an [official stance was taken][Official stance on code trolling]: [tag:code-trolling] is no longer welcome. A massive clean up was organised, and 47 of the 60 existing [tag:code-trolling] questions were removed. If you have 10000 or more reputation and would like to see those, [here's a query with links][SEDE query].

However, this clean up required users with moderation powers to use them for the Greater Good™ at a time where PPCG had [very few active moderating users][call to action]. Organised by [Doorknob], a [call to action] was put out, and, a few months later, it was officially [requested] that PPCG have another moderator appointed - specifically nominating Doorknob. On May 7th 2014, Doorknob was [officially given a diamond], something he's kept for the past 7 years as he's competently moderated the site through the rest of the events I'll be recounting.

2014 and 2015 were pivotal times for PPCG. Key community posts, such as the [FAQ] were created during this time to help new users, there was [serious discussion] [about] [the future] and [purpose] of the site, and the dedicated community exploded in size. Users like [Alex A.], [Geobits], [Rainbolt] and many more became leading figures in the site's *community*, and made full use of chat as a "third place". This sense of community is what demarcates PPCG/CGCC from other golfing sites, leading to [site specific memes and references][memes] that live on [to this day].

With this new community, came new leaders. In March 2015, Chris Jester-Young [stepped down] as a moderator after being hired as a developer at Stack Exchange. He nominated [Martin Ender] (then Büttner) to replace. [Confirmed] by [popular choice], Martin joined the moderator team and served as one of the most explemplary moderators for 3 more years. As part of the moderation team, he helped define some of the biggest site policies, such as [establishing I/O defaults][defaults], our policy on [newer languages] being allowed, and starting the discussion about the fact that [CGCC isn't a Q&A site][qa site] and how we fit with the Stack Exchange model. Furthermore, he helped [spread the word][interview] about esolangs and golfing langs, a pivotal part of the CGCC community.

5 months later, dmckee, after over 4 years, stepped down as a moderator, prompting an informal [moderator election]. Initially, one moderator position was available, and it appeared that [Dennis had it in the bag][Dennis vote]. However, due to circumstances unknown to all but the moderators and Community Managers, it was decided to offer the position to *both* [Dennis and Alex A.] At this point, the mod team had undergone far more changes than is typical for a Stack Exchange site not yet graduated. However, from now until 2016, the team was and would stay as Doorknob, Martin Ender, Dennis, Alex A and Chris Jester-Young\${}^1\$

As a strong and healthy site, PPCG and it's community thrived. However, after 1846 days in beta, we felt somewhat neglected or ignored by Stack Exchange. Various pushes to increase activity, efforts to increase the number of high reputation users, etc. were all ignored. Until February 23rd, 2016.

## Graduation
