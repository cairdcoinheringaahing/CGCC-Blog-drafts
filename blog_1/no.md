Javascript, Python, and Jelly are the top three languages on CGCC. If you pick a random challenge from the last few years, chances are you'll see all three of them. One of these languages stands out. It's far golfier, but also far more disliked.

Those who have been on the site for a while will know that answers (officially) compete only with other answers in the same language. That unfortunately isn't immediately obvious to new users. Posting a 200 byte Python answer when there's 10 bytes of strange unicode in first place is discouraging. Why bother, when you don't know any of the languages that are consistently at the top?

Golfing languages are also designed for one thing: golfing. In JS or Python, you'd have to balance the byte counts of potentially dozens of approaches to a part of a problem. You would need to take into account how changing the syntax in one place affects it in others. In Jelly or 05AB1E, many answers are just a few built-ins strung together.

Entire classes of challenges can be completely trivialized by golfing languages. Prime-related challenges, for example. While it costs you 30-40 bytes for a primality check in most practical languages, a golfing language can do that in a single byte. You could argue that these challenges are already trivial if they could be solved in a few bytes in a golfing language, but it could also be that golfing languages make a larger number of challenges count as trivial.

Overall, golfing languages can be discouraging to new users, and trivialize many problems.
